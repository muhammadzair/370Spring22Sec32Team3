#Design Information

I have created a UML class design of a Floor Supply Store. I have listed all the classes, attributes,
operations, and relationships in the diagram.

In this diagram, I have come up with 9 classes. These classes were Store, User, Employees, Vinyl, Tiles,
Stone, Laminate, Wood, and Floors.

Each classes has their own attributes and methods based on information found in Assignment 5: Software design.
User and Employee class has their own methods where user can search products with searchProducts() and employee can use method to add, delete, and edit methods.

Vinyl and Laminate has attribute waterResistant as a boolean because the values could be true or false.
Floors has a lot of attribute such as a color, size, brand, type, and price.

In the diagram the data types for each attributes is stated also

The diagram also shows the relationships between each classes.
