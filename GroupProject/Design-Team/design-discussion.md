    Pros:
        It clearly visualizes the design pattern that includes user, store manager and employee.
        It clearly shows that the user requirement can be fulfilled as per the requirements such as color, size, brand, type and price.
        It has mentioned that employee can add, edit and remove the items from the product Database.
        It tells that store manager can also get the items information from the product database. 
    Cons:
        Only one database (DB of floor) is required.
        It has not implemented the specific items like tile, stone, wood, laminate and vinyl.
        It has added extra items i.e. product manger and store manager.
        Did not complete requirement 5 for users to use the hierarchical list

    Pros
        Clear relationships from different class
        
    Cons: 
        User sure be able to look into different store directly
        Requirement 5 is not complete
        Employee should be an employee of the single store but a user can be in different stores

## Team Design:

    We have picked design 2 and added more relationship definition
    Add Store name to represent different stores
    We agree with that floor category and other attributes to be saved in DB that can be searched by searching function



## Summary

    As we discussed the design pattern from group 3, we finalized the design pattern that fulfills most of the requirements.
